As I start my journey into learning more about software engineering, I have a few expectations and goals that I want to learn.  But, to start I want to iterate why I want to learn more about software engineering and work in this field. For starters, learning software engineering allows you to be able to create things to a greater ability than before. Previously in school we have been promoted to create small assignments and projects using Java, such as creating a skeleton database for an airport system which manages passengers, flights, and availability for seating. This is great and all, but we could take this one step further. Using concepts and ideas from software engineering, we are going to be able to create more than a console interface. We are going to be able to build programs and systems more efficiently and to a higher level which would be actually usable. So learning this is going to bring in a whole new level of creativity and new possibilities. 
Another real life application toward learning and working in software engineering is that this field is extremely fast growing, constantly changing, and so diverse. Software engineering ranges from the development of computer games, networks, phone processors and applications, and other various computer like products. For me personally, I have always really enjoyed playing video games since I was young and have dreamed of working in this field. Video games have played a huge role in my life. Whether it was a medium to hang out and spend time with friends, make new friends, or just spend time by myself, I want to create4 the same for someone else. Another very different topic I love are cars. The technology in cars is advancing very fast, such as the new additions to electric and hybrid cars, to even automatic braking systems. These things need software engineers to be able to design working and efficient computer systems for the car to run on. 
In my current class focusing on software engineering, there are many things I hope to learn, but more specifically I want to learn web design and general software engineering skills which are needed when working.  Web design is such a simple task, but to be able to design optimal and effective websites is key to creating a good face to a company or product. I’d want to learn more than just how to make something pretty, I want to learn the ideas and concepts that go into creating usable programs. Another thing I would like to learn is the basics of video games design, like connecting programs and functions to a movable and interactable visual. This can be similar to creating different interactable functions and aspects of a web program. Overall, from this class I mainly want to learn things that I wouldn’t be able to easily learn elsewhere.
