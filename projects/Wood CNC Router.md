summary:Design and creating 3D wood routing files to be cut for art purposes. 
---

Recentlying this summer of 2020, my family got a wood router to be able to create and design pieces of wood for art purposes.  A router is similar to a 3D printer in that it takes in a file which tells the head where to move, and for a router, it slowly cuts aways from the set block of wood.  My sister has been creating a small Etsy shop selling art pieces of her resin works,  which consist of different types of colored resin deigns on verious shapes of wood. So my project this summer was to create and design interesting shapes and design in wood for her to resin.

My design process is to first gather information as to what she wants, such as wanting different animals shapes of different sizes or patterns of waves. Then I take that and create a 2D design in Adobe Photoshop of each individual layer, so one of the outline cut, the inner cutout, and other various layers if needed. And then I import this into Vetric VCarve which is a 3D routing software which uses vectors to create 3D models which can then be saved and sent to a router to process. This sum

So far I have designed a few pieces for my sister along with4 a few of some Hawaiian islands to be eventually used as coasters.
