summary: Working towards creating a better portfolio. 
---

For a while I have enjoyed photography, specifically portraits, and recently I have been working towards creating better content and a better final portfolio. I have been trying to expand my horizons and start shooting in situations which are not optimal and to adapt and make the best of the current situation. And I have been focusing on learning and developing my skills in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom to be able to edit and create something that I am proud of. Below is a before and after of a photo I shot at night which had brighter background exposure and darker foreground. I am working towards creating things which I like, while also trying to improve my current skills.
