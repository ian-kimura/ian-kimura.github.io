Summary: Working towards creating a better portfolio. 
---

For a while I have enjoyed photgraphy, specifally portraits, and recently I have ben working towards creating better content and a better final portfolio. I have been trying to expand my horizons and start shooting in situations which arent optimal and to make be adapt and make the best of the current situation. And I have been focusing on learning and developing my skills in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom to be able to edit and creating somthing that I am proud of.  Below is a before and after of a phot I shot at night which had brighter background exposure and darker foreground. I am working towards creating things which I like, while also trying to improve my current skills.
